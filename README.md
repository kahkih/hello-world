# hello-world
Kah Kih is an interaction design engineer with a mad interest in what drives people to interact. 
A dreamer who thinks on his feet and has the curiosity of a cat combined with the will to build. Kah Kih has the skill to bring analysis and feeling together into harmony from vision to product. He likes to get his hands dirty in the process of bringing products to life. Sanding, soldering, cutting...if it gets things done...it gets things done. Thinking and building go hand in hand, when you build, you think. 
His mind leaps like the Hulk and when he lands...The Hulk does not land, he crashes.
